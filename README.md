# Development and validation of a predictive index of elder self-neglect risk among a Chinese population

# Background 

Elder self-neglect occurs when an older adult’s inability to perform essential self-care tasks—such as maintaining food, shelter, medical care, or financial affairs—threatens their health and safety. It may lead to mental disorders, increased premature mortality, and higher healthcare utilization.

Among Asian Americans, the Chinese aging population (4 million) is the fastest-growing subgroup. Factors such as limited English proficiency, poorer health, and inadequate healthcare access may exacerbate self-neglect, posing significant public health challenges.

Currently, diagnosing self-neglect requires in-home assessments, which are impractical for clinicians who frequently interact with at-risk older adults. By the time self-neglect is identified, cases are often severe, costly, and resistant to treatment. Therefore, an early detection risk index is crucial for predicting and intervening self-neglect.

# Project goal

Our goal was to develop a **simple point-based predictive index** to estimate risk prognostication of self-neglect onset.
